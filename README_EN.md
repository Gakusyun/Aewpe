## Teacher, look at me, look at me!!!!!!!!!!!
 Aewpe is an optimized version of the simple "loop scrolling subtitles" program, I removed the last sentence 'If I = Len(S) Then I = 0', so it will only scroll once; The interval between 200ms is too short, and before I can see the last word, I assign '0' to 'I', which is more intuitive after modification.

Sewpe is an addition and subtraction calculator written by myself
 
How to use: Enter the first number, then click "Number 2" in the lower right corner, enter the second number, select "Plus" or "Subtract", and the Label1 control will display the result.
 
The green button "<>code" in the upper right corner - Download Zip can download all the source code 'include<README.md>' 'If you use your mobile phone to scan the QR code, it may not be easy to download. Can try to download in Releases'
 
In this project, some fonts use the [Smiley Sans](https://github.com/atelier-anchor/smiley-sans) font by Mr.[oooooohmygosh](https://space.bilibili.com/38053181).
