The junk project written in VB for the lab class

[Japanese] (README_JP.md) [Chinese Simplified] (README.md) [Chinese Traditional] (README_TC.md)
## Teacher, look at me, look at me!!!!!!!!!!!
 Aewpe is an optimized version of the simple "loop scrolling subtitles" program, I removed the last sentence 'If I = Len(S) Then I = 0', so it will only scroll once; The interval between 200ms is too short, and before I can see the last word, I am assigned 0, which is more intuitive after modification.

Sewpe is an addition and subtraction calculator written by myself
 
How to use: Enter the first number, then click "Number 2" in the lower right corner, after entering the second number, select "Add" or "Subtract", the Label1 control will display the result.
 
The green button "<>code" in the upper right corner - Download Zip can download all the source code 'include<README.md>' 'If you use your mobile phone to scan the QR code, you may not be able to download it easily. You can try downloading ''' in Releases
 
In this project, some fonts use the [Proud Black] (https://github.com/atelier-anchor/smiley-sans) font by Mr. [oooooohmygosh] (https://space.bilibili.com/38053181).
